# MAC-Address-Lookup
Tired of paying a subscription service to access an API to resolve MAC address data? Just resolving locally and maintaining your own database with this project is faster, cheaper (FREE!), and more secure.

**This repo requires either the master.txt or simplified.txt lookup table to be present in the same directory to function.  
Visit the following URL for more information and to download the latest lookup tables:  
https://scripttiger.github.io/macs/**

To get started, download the below ZIP file and extract the contents to the same directory as either the master.txt or simplified.txt:  
https://github.com/ScriptTiger/MAC-Address-Lookup/archive/master.zip

Can be used interactively or simply by using the commmand "oui_search XX-XX-XX-XX-XX-XX" for quicker scripted searches. Accepts all standard mac address formats: XX-XX-XX-XX-XX-XX, XXXX-XXXX-XXXX, XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX, XXXX:XXXX:XXXX, XXXXXXXXXXXX, etc.
